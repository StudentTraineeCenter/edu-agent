# Notes

Notes are AI-generated study notes created from project documents. They provide comprehensive markdown-formatted content that helps students understand and review course materials.

## Note Generation

### Process

1. User requests note creation with an optional topic and custom instructions.
2. System searches project documents for relevant content.
3. AI analyzes document content and generates structured notes.
4. Notes are saved with title, description, and markdown content.

### Generation Parameters

- `topic`: Topic for the note (e.g., `"overview of Chapter 5"`, `"summary of key theorems"`).
- `custom_instructions`: Free-form instructions for tone/structure/focus (e.g., `"bullet points only"`, `"explain like I'm 12"`, `"focus on proofs"`).
- `project_id`: Project containing source documents.

## Note Structure

Each note contains:

- **Title**: Auto-generated or user-provided title.
- **Description**: Brief explanation of note content.
- **Content**: Markdown-formatted study notes with:
  - Structured sections and headings.
  - Key concepts and definitions.
  - Explanations and examples.
  - Organized information hierarchy.

## Note Features

- **Create Note**: Generate a new note with AI-generated content.
- **List Notes**: View all notes in a project.
- **Get Note**: Retrieve note details and content.
- **Update Note**: Modify note title, description, or content.
- **Delete Note**: Remove a note.

## Topic Filtering

Notes are generated from specific topics by providing a `topic` (and optionally `custom_instructions`):

- The topic is used to search for relevant documents.
- Only matching document content is used for generation.
- Custom instructions refine structure, tone, and level of detail.

## Note Quality

Generated notes follow these guidelines:

- Well-structured with clear headings and sections.
- Comprehensive coverage of key concepts.
- Markdown formatting for readability.
- Organized information hierarchy.
- Focus on important educational content.
