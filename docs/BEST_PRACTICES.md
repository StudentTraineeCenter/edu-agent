## Best Practices

### Document Management

1. **Upload Quality Documents**: Use well-structured documents with clear headings.
2. **Wait for Processing**: Allow time for documents to be fully indexed before use.
3. **Monitor Status**: Check document status before generating quizzes/flashcards.
4. **Organize by Project**: Group related documents in the same project.

### Quiz Generation

1. **Provide Context**: Use topics and custom instructions to focus quiz generation on specific areas.
2. **Reasonable Counts**: Generate 10–30 questions for optimal quality.
3. **Review Questions**: Check generated questions for accuracy.
4. **Use Results**: Submit quiz answers to track progress.

### Flashcard Creation

1. **Topic Focus**: Use topics to create focused flashcard sets.
2. **Use Progress Tracking**: Rely on flashcard progress and practice records to guide study.
3. **Study Regularly**: Practice flashcards consistently.
4. **Mix Difficulties**: Generated flashcards include various difficulty levels.
5. **Review Answers**: Study both questions and answers thoroughly.
6. **Use Study Sessions**: Generate adaptive study sessions for personalized learning.
7. **Track Progress**: Monitor practice records to identify weak areas.
8. **Review Due Cards**: Prioritize flashcards due for review.
9. **Focus on Weak Topics**: Use sessions and practice analytics to focus on low-accuracy topics.

### Chat Usage

2. **Set Language**: Configure language code for non-English content.
3. **Descriptive Names**: Use clear project names for easy identification.
4. **Regular Cleanup**: Delete unused projects to manage storage.

## Limitations

- **File Size**: Large documents may take longer to process.
- **Daily Limits**: Usage limits reset daily, not per hour.
- **Language Support**: Quality depends on Azure OpenAI language capabilities.
- **Processing Time**: Document processing is asynchronous and may take time.
- **Storage**: Blob storage and database storage have capacity limits.

## Support

For issues or questions:

1. Check document processing status.
2. Verify usage limits haven't been exceeded.
3. Review error messages in API responses.
4. Check logs for detailed error information.
